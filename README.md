# Projective Geometry Playground
The Projective Geometry Playground is a web based application to do experiments with mathematical projections of images.The projective geometry playground runs offline in browser  and learner can define a projection as mathematical mapping and visualized the result in HTML canvas. This allows visual debugging of mathamtical mapping. 

## History 
The Projective Geometry Playground was created as an learning environment for a Wikiversity Learning about [Equirectangular Projection](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection)
