# projective_geometry_playground
the Projective Geometry Playground is a web based application to do experiments with mathematical projections of images.The projective geometry playground runs offline in browser  and learner can define a projection as mathematical mapping and visualized the result in HTML canvas. This allows visual debugging of mathamtical mapping.
